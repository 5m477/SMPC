# Advanced Cryptographic Techniques
  ```bash
## Overview
This repository contains two powerful cryptographic implementations demonstrating advanced privacy and security techniques:

1. **Threshold Secret Sharing** (`threshold_secret_sharing.py`)
2. **Garbled Circuits** (`garbled_circuits.py`)

---

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- Required libraries: Install them using:
  ```bash
  pip install sympy colorama termcolor cryptography

1. Threshold Secret Sharing
What is Threshold Secret Sharing?
- Threshold Secret Sharing is a cryptographic method that splits a secret into multiple shares, allowing reconstruction only when a minimum number of shares are combined. This technique ensures:

•	Secure distribution of sensitive information: No single share reveals the entire secret.
•	Configurable reconstruction threshold: You control how many shares are needed to unlock the secret.

---

Features
•	Generate n total shares.
•	Require t shares to reconstruct the secret.
•	Uses mathematical principles of polynomial interpolation.
•	Secure modular arithmetic with prime numbers.

---

Usage
•	Run the script and follow the interactive prompts:
  ```bash
python threshold_secret_sharing.py

---

Example Interaction
•	Enter a secret (integer).
•	Specify the total number of shares.
•	Set the threshold for reconstruction.
•	Select shares to reconstruct the secret.
•	Example Scenario
•	Total Shares: 5
•	Reconstruction Threshold: 3
•	Only 3 out of 5 shares are needed to recover the secret.

2. Garbled Circuits
What are Garbled Circuits?
-	Garbled Circuits enable secure two-party computation where parties can jointly compute a function without revealing their individual inputs. This technique:

o	Preserves input privacy.
o	Allows computation on encrypted data.
o	Prevents either party from learning the other's input.

---

Features
•	Demonstrates secure AND gate computation.
•	Uses cryptographic key generation.
•	Implements secure encryption and decryption.
•	Prevents input value inference.

---

Usage
•	Run the script and follow the interactive prompts:
  ```bash
python garbled_circuits.py

---

Example Interaction
•	Alice enters her secret input (0 or 1).
•	Bob enters his secret input (0 or 1).
•	The script computes the AND gate result securely.
•	Security Considerations
•	Use sufficiently large prime numbers.
•	Protect encryption keys.
•	Implement additional security layers for production use.
